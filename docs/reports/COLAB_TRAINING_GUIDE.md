## **⚠️ Important Notes**

### **Data Leakage Prevention**
- Target variables are properly excluded from features
- Time series cross-validation used
- No future information leakage

### **GPU Requirements**
- T4 or V100 GPU recommended
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- Training will be much slower on CPU

### **Monitoring**
- Watch for overfitting (validation loss)
- Monitor GPU memory usage
- Check training progress every 30 minutes
