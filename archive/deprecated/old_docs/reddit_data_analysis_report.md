# üöÄ Reddit Data Value Analysis for Meme Stock Prediction

**Generated:** August 14, 2025  
**Experiment Type:** Machine Learning Model Comparison  
**Objective:** Evaluate the value of Reddit sentiment data in meme stock return prediction

## üìä Executive Summary

Our comprehensive analysis reveals **limited evidence for Reddit data value** in its current form for meme stock prediction. While Reddit data contains market sentiment information, our experiments show that adding Reddit features generally **degrades model performance** rather than improving it.

### Key Findings:
- **Average IC Improvement:** -0.0255 (negative)
- **Models showing improvement:** 1 out of 3 tested models
- **Best Performance:** Ridge regression with price-only features (IC: 0.0240)
- **Target Achievement:** None of the models achieved the target IC ‚â• 0.03

## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Overview
- **Training Samples:** 3,759
- **Validation Samples:** 822  
- **Test Samples:** 828
- **Price Features:** 18 (technical indicators, volatility, market timing)
- **Reddit Features:** 20 (mentions, sentiment, momentum, attention metrics)

### Models Tested
1. **Ridge Regression** - Linear regularized model
2. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting ensemble
3. **LightGBM** - Light gradient boosting machine

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Information Coefficient (IC):** Correlation between predictions and actual returns
- **Rank IC:** Spearman rank correlation (primary metric)
- **Hit Rate:** Directional accuracy
- **RMSE:** Root mean squared error

## üìà Detailed Results

### Model Performance Comparison

| Model | Baseline IC | Enhanced IC | Improvement | Hit Rate Change |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Ridge | 0.0240 | -0.0019 | **-0.0259** | -0.0121 |
| XGBoost | 0.0153 | -0.0410 | **-0.0563** | -0.0169 |
| LightGBM | -0.0250 | -0.0193 | **+0.0057** | +0.0170 |

### Key Observations

1. **Ridge Regression:** Best baseline performance but significant degradation with Reddit data
2. **XGBoost:** Moderate baseline performance, substantial degradation with Reddit data  
3. **LightGBM:** Poor baseline performance, slight improvement with Reddit data

## üß† Analysis and Interpretation

### Why Reddit Data Underperforms

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Reddit sentiment may contain too much noise relative to predictive signal
2. **Feature Engineering:** Current Reddit features may not capture the most relevant aspects of social sentiment
3. **Temporal Alignment:** Reddit sentiment timing may not align optimally with return prediction horizons
4. **Market Efficiency:** Professional traders may already incorporate social sentiment, reducing its predictive edge

### Comparison with Previous Results

Our current results contradict previous findings where Reddit LightGBM achieved IC=0.0812. The discrepancy suggests:

1. **Possible Data Leakage:** Previous high IC values may have been inflated by temporal data leakage
2. **Overfitting:** Previous models may have overfit to specific market conditions
3. **Feature Evolution:** Market dynamics may have changed, reducing Reddit's predictive power

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Focus on Price-Based Features:** Current price and technical indicators show more promise
2. **Feature Engineering:** Develop more sophisticated Reddit sentiment features
3. **Temporal Analysis:** Investigate optimal time lags between Reddit sentiment and returns

### Advanced Approaches
1. **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models to potentially capture Reddit signal
2. **Deep Learning:** Use neural networks to extract complex patterns from Reddit data
3. **Alternative Data:** Consider other social media platforms or sentiment sources
4. **Regime-Based Models:** Build separate models for different market conditions
