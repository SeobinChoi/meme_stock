## 📋 **Detailed Issue Analysis**

### 1. **Reddit Features Verification** ⚠️
**Status:** WARNING
**Issues Found:**
- **Missing Features**: 2 expected features not found
  - `reddit_total_score` (found `reddit_total_score_x` instead)
  - `reddit_avg_score` (found `reddit_avg_score_x` instead)
- **Extra Features**: 6 additional features detected
  - `reddit_total_score_x`, `reddit_avg_score_x`
  - `reddit_posts`, `reddit_total_score_y`, `reddit_avg_score_y`, `reddit_comments`

**Impact:** Minor - naming convention differences, functionality preserved

### 2. **Temporal Alignment** ⚠️
**Status:** WARNING
**Issues Found:**
- **Date Ranges**: All stocks align (2020-01-02 to 2021-12-30)
- **Missing Dates**: 557 missing dates per stock
- **Expected Gaps**: 208 expected gaps (weekends/holidays)
- **Unexpected Gaps**: 349 additional missing dates

**Impact:** Moderate - may affect feature engineering for certain time periods

### 3. **Data Leakage Check** ❌
**Status:** FAIL
**Critical Issues Found:**
- **Future Data Leakage**: 1 issue
  - `cross_modal_sentiment_future_GME_corr` - contains future information
- **Target Contamination**: 12 potential issues
  - All stock return features (`GME_returns_1d`, `AMC_returns_1d`, `BB_returns_1d`) are in the feature set
  - This creates perfect correlation with targets, making models unreliable

**Impact:** CRITICAL - This will cause severe overfitting and invalid predictions

---

## 🔧 **Immediate Action Required**

### **Priority 1: Fix Data Leakage** 🚨
1. **Remove target variables from features:**
   - Remove all `*_returns_*` columns from the feature set
   - These should be used as targets, not features

2. **Fix future data leakage:**
   - Review `cross_modal_sentiment_future_GME_corr` feature
   - Ensure it only uses past information

### **Priority 2: Address Temporal Gaps** ⚠️
1. **Investigate missing dates:**
   - 349 unexpected missing dates need investigation
   - Check if this is due to data collection issues or market closures

2. **Validate feature engineering:**
   - Ensure features are properly aligned with available dates
   - Check for any date-related feature calculation errors

### **Priority 3: Standardize Feature Naming** 📝
1. **Consolidate duplicate features:**
   - Decide on standard naming convention
   - Remove or rename duplicate features (e.g., `_x` vs `_y` suffixes)

## 📊 **Feature Quality Assessment**

### **Reddit Features: 48/44 Expected** ✅
- **Total Features**: 48 Reddit features generated
- **Feature Categories**:
  - Engagement metrics: ✅ Complete
  - Sentiment analysis: ✅ Complete
  - Linguistic features: ✅ Complete
  - Temporal patterns: ✅ Complete

### **Data Completeness: 99.8%** ✅
- **Missing Data**: Only 0.20% missing values
- **Sample Size**: 3,330 samples
- **Feature Coverage**: 215 total features

### **Feature Correlation Issues** ⚠️
- **Constant Features**: 15 Reddit features have no variation
- **Multicollinearity**: 132 highly correlated feature pairs (>0.95)
- **Correlation with Targets**: All correlations showing NaN (data leakage issue)

---

## 🎯 **Recommendations for Model Training**

### **Before Training:**
1. **Clean Feature Set:**
   ```python
   # Remove target variables from features
   target_columns = [col for col in df.columns if 'returns_' in col]
   feature_df = df.drop(columns=target_columns)
   ```

2. **Handle Multicollinearity:**
   ```python
   # Remove highly correlated features
   # Keep one feature from each highly correlated pair
   ```

3. **Remove Constant Features:**
   ```python
   # Remove features with no variation
   constant_features = [col for col in df.columns if df[col].nunique() <= 1]
   feature_df = feature_df.drop(columns=constant_features)
   ```

### **Feature Selection Strategy:**
1. **Primary Features**: Keep core engagement and sentiment metrics
2. **Secondary Features**: Include linguistic and temporal patterns
3. **Cross-Modal Features**: Validate they don't contain future information
4. **Target Variables**: Use only for training, not as features

## 📈 **Expected Impact After Fixes**

### **Data Quality Improvement:**
- **Overall Status**: FAIL → PASS
- **Data Leakage**: FAIL → PASS
- **Temporal Alignment**: WARNING → PASS
- **Reddit Features**: WARNING → PASS

### **Model Performance:**
- **Eliminate Overfitting**: Remove perfect correlations with targets
- **Improve Generalization**: Clean feature set with proper validation
- **Better Cross-Validation**: No data leakage issues
- **Reliable Predictions**: Features only use past information
